# Python Tools

[[日本語](readmeja.md)]

This is a repo of personal, independent script files that I often use. Each file handles small tasks such as:

- converting mp4 videos to jpg frames (mov works as well)
- converting jpg files to animated gifs
- converting jpg files to mp4 videos (or avi videos)
- ~~creating QR codes for URLs saved in csv files~~

## Description of each file and how to use them

## Note

Not all files' parameters can changed via `python3 script.py -argument parameter`. Some files may require directly altering the parameters in the code. Run `python3 script.py -h` for instructions to see if parameters can be set via terminal.
